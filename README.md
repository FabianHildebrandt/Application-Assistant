This project demonstrates the power of **multi-agent collaboration** powered by **Gradio**’s UI framework and the **LangGraph**'s agent framework.

## 🤖 What Can It Do?

- 👥 **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Breaks down tasks into sub-tasks handled by specialized agents (e.g., Writer agent, critic agent, interview agent).
